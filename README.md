Overview
This model simulates soil moisture and evapotranspiration time series, providing valuable insights for water resource management, agricultural planning, and climate studies. It is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding soil-plant-atmosphere interactions.

Features
Soil Moisture Simulation: Computes daily or sub-daily soil moisture dynamics.

Evapotranspiration Estimation: Estimates actual evapotranspiration based on soil and atmospheric conditions.

Flexible Inputs: Accepts meteorological data (precipitation, temperature, etc.) and soil parameters.

Customizable Parameters: Allows users to adjust model parameters for different soil types and vegetation.

Visualization: Includes scripts for plotting time series and analyzing results.

Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher

Required Python packages:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scipy (optional, for advanced features)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/soil-moisture-model.git
cd soil-moisture-model
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your input data (see example_data.csv for format).

Run the model:

python
python main.py --input example_data.csv --output results.csv
Visualize results:

python
python plot_results.py --input results.csv
For advanced usage, refer to the documentation (link to detailed docs if available).

Model Description
The model integrates soil water balance and energy balance equations to simulate soil moisture and evapotranspiration. It accounts for precipitation, infiltration, drainage, and plant water uptake, providing a realistic representation of soil-plant-atmosphere processes.

Outputs
Time series of soil moisture (daily/sub-daily)

Time series of evapotranspiration

Summary statistics and diagnostic plots

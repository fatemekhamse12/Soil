Overview
This model simulates soil moisture and evapotranspiration time series, providing valuable insights for water resource management, agricultural planning, and climate studies. It is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding soil-plant-atmosphere interactions.
Features
Soil Moisture Simulation: Computes daily or sub-daily soil moisture dynamics.

Evapotranspiration Estimation: Estimates actual evapotranspiration based on soil and atmospheric conditions.

Flexible Inputs: Accepts meteorological data (precipitation, temperature, etc.) and soil parameters.

Customizable Parameters: Allows users to adjust model parameters for different soil types and vegetation.

Visualization: Includes scripts for plotting time series and analyzing results.

Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher

Required Python packages:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scipy (optional, for advanced features)
